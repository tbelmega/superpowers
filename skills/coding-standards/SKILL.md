# Coding Standards

## Overview

Type safety, comments, and naming conventions for consistent, maintainable code.

## Type Safety

Types enforce contracts between caller and callee. Stricter typing reduces room for error and lessens the need for testing and documentation.

- **Strong, explicit types** — Declare explicit types for all function signatures.
- **Strict null checks** — Use non-nullable types by default. Handle `null` and `undefined` explicitly.
- **Don't work around the type system** — No `any`, no non-null assertions, no unchecked type casts.
- Import library types if available, rather than defining custom types for input/output of libraries.
- Keep typing in sync with input validation at system boundaries.
- Aim for cross-service type safety, e.g. sharing the same type files between frontend and backend.
- Make use of generic types, union types and branded strings to strengthen typing.

## Comments and Documentation

### When to Comment

- **Explain purpose** — Why the code exists, not what it does
- **Provide context** — Business logic, edge cases, or non-obvious behavior
- **Document complexity** — Algorithms, workarounds, or non-standard patterns
- **Clarify intent** — When the code might be misunderstood

### When NOT to Comment

- **Don't state the obvious** — Avoid comments that just restate what the code clearly shows
- **Don't repeat function/variable names** — Function names should be self-documenting
- **Don't repeat type information** — JSDoc should not duplicate TypeScript type signatures
- **Don't document trivial logic** — Simple, straightforward code doesn't need comments

## Naming Conventions

- **Self-documenting names** — Names should convey purpose; no abbreviations or acronyms
- **Consistent style** — Follow existing codebase conventions (camelCase, PascalCase, etc.)
- **Avoid generic names** — `data`, `info`, `handler` only when context makes them clear. **Never** `helper` or `manager`.
- **Avoid generic file names** — Names like `handler.ts`, `utils.ts`, `service.ts` that repeat across the codebase degrade search and tab navigation. Prefer domain-specific names (e.g. `create-tenant.handler.ts`, `email-validation.utils.ts`).
